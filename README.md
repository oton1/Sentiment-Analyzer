This code basically analyze the sentiment scores of different reviews of far-right book that is being sold on Amazon.
It uses NLTK library to do the sentiment analysis, and Matplotlib and Wordcloud for presentation, 
presenting the outputs of the code in a understandable way. 
My goal doing this is to show that data science can make a way into the History field, and to demonstrate that
even if these far-right books are well-reviewed, there are dissent comments.
Even more further, the historians need to understand deeply why these books, which are written with lies, misinformation and historiographically wrong info, make so much success in the Brasilian market.
It's important to note that this is my first time attempt doing this kind of analysis, and it will have problems.
Furthermore, this can show that the opinions of regular, non-academic folks, can be useful to understand why the History area in Brasil is suffering to communicate with people that are outside the University matters.
